### Concurrent Game of Life in xC Language

A second-year pair coursework. We implemented the Game of Life in xC, a language that is a supserset of C that allows for concurrent programming in the message passing paradigm. The xC language is designed to run on XMOS boards. They contain multi-core processors, some RAM, an accelerometer and some buttons. Features like pausing the game upon tilting the board or writing the current game state to file in parallel upon pressing a button are also implemented. We achieved a First Class grade.
